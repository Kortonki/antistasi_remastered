//Use bis_fnc_safe pos

//check bounding boxes for nearest objects 10-20 meters

//Consider if objdistance should be the distance from nearest bounding box

//Check if vehicle is closer than the biggest bounding box of objects AND vehicles nearby

//If it is -> new safePos with the objdistance as the biggest bounding box
